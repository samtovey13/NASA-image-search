# React App: Tech Test

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). \
\
This is an exercise to prepare for a tech test when applying for a junior developer role.

## The Brief

You are expected to build a React web application that allows users to search for images based on a query relating to space. You are provided the NASA API endpoint for image search.\
\
We want you to consider and add anything to your repository that should be included was this to be a live website.

The following functionalities need to be implemented:
* A Search page which allows users to search for images by keyword
* Images must be returned upon a successful search

The styling is up to you but will be taken into consideration when evaluating your application.\
\
We estimate this task to take ​​10 hours​​. Once you have completed the task upload the repository to GitHub and send the link to xxxxx@xxx.com. ​Deadline: 5 days from receiving.

### **Relevant API endpoints:**

image search: \
GET​​ ​​[https://images-api.nasa.gov/search](https://images-api.nasa.gov/search) ​Params: ​​q

### **Assets:**

You may use this asset for your application: https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200424060716-nasa-worm-logo.jpg

# Run the App

To run the app locally on your machine, clone the repo and use the following from the command line inside the project directory:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode and opens [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits and you will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
